# GPT-wrapper

This repository contains the TypeScript wrapper code for the OpenAI API. The wrapper is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  With this wrapper, you can replace long boilerplate code with a single line of code, making it easier to integrate GPT functionality into your projects.

## Development Setup
- Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js (>= v18) and npm installed. (Learn more about Node.js and npm [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).)
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key to it.  You may refer to the `.env.example` file for an example.
- Run `npm run sample` to run the sample code in `src/sample.ts`.
